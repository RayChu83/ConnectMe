<h2>📜 Project description</h2>
<p>Connect Me is a online social network where users can create and interact with posts, adjust profiles, connect with others by following & more. The final product can be seen <a href="https://app-connectme.netlify.app">here</a>.</p>
<h2>🔍 My approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1. Gather inspiration from Twitter/X</strong></li>
  <p>The first step involved reviewing the existing layout and features of Twitter/X.</p>
  <li><strong>2. Creating a Mockup with HTML and CSS</strong></li>
  <p>After reviewing the design/features, I soon developing a static mockup of the layout using HTML and CSS.</p>
  <li><strong>3. Designing the User Interface for Static Components</strong></li>
  <p>Next, I designed the user interface for all the static components and incorporated the previously created mockup layout.</p>
  <li><strong>4. Integrating Firebase for Dynamic Functionality</strong></li>
  <p>Lastly, I integrated Cloud Firestore, Authentication, and Cloud Storage from Firebase to turn the static mock up layout into a dynamic layout. Additionally I created the profile page and the detailed post page to complete the app.</p>
</ul>
